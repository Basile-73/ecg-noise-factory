# Synthetic noise configuration combining traditional and new noise types
# for comprehensive ECG signal augmentation testing
#
# DISABLING NOISE TYPES:
# - For SNR-based noises (bw, ma, em, AWGN): set value to null to disable
# - For synthetic noises (sine_noise, spike_noise, trunc_noise): set include to false to disable

# Traditional SNR-based noise types
# SNR values from Hu et al. 2023 (acceptable range: 0-30 dB)
SNR:
  bw: 2.5 # 0 - 5 or null to disable
  ma: 7.5 # 5 - 10 or null to disable
  em: 12.5 # 10 - 15 or null to disable
  AWGN: 22.5 # 20 - 25 or null to disable

# Multi-frequency interference simulation
# Simulates complex interference patterns from baseline wander and powerline noise
sine_noise:
  include: true # set to false to disable
  snr: 15.0 # Moderate noise level (dB)
  min_freq: 0.5 # Minimum frequency (Hz) - low-frequency baseline wander
  max_freq: 50.0 # Maximum frequency (Hz) - covers physiological range and powerline interference
  number_of_frequencies: 3 # Number of sine waves to sum for complex patterns

# Electrode contact artifacts and impulse noise simulation
# Simulates brief spikes from poor electrode contact or external impulses
spike_noise:
  include: true # set to false to disable
  amplitude: 2 # Spike amplitude relative to normalized ECG
  spike_duration: 1 # Duration in samples (~50ms@100Hz, ~14ms@360Hz, ~10ms@500Hz)
  min_number_of_spikes: 1 # Minimum number of spikes per signal
  max_number_of_spikes: 5 # Maximum number of spikes per signal

# Signal dropout and sensor disconnection simulation
# Simulates temporary signal loss from sensor disconnection or data transmission errors
trunc_noise:
  include: true # set to false to disable
  min_length: 50 # Minimum dropout duration in samples (~0.5s@100Hz, ~0.14s@360Hz, ~0.1s@500Hz)
  max_length: 200 # Maximum dropout duration in samples (~2s@100Hz, ~0.56s@360Hz, ~0.4s@500Hz)

# Example: To disable spike_noise entirely, use:
# spike_noise:
#   include: false  # Disabled
