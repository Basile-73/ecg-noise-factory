# To build
# 1. python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
# 2. python3 -m build
# 3. Now you have a new dist/ folder with source distribution (.tar.gz) and built distribution (.whl)
        # Note: Newer pip versions preferentially install built distributions, but will fall back to source
        # distributions if needed.

# To upload to distribution archives
# 1. python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
# 2. python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*


# Issues:
# ERROR    InvalidDistribution: Invalid distribution metadata: unrecognized or malformed field 'license-file'
# But there is not "license-file"-key in .toml
# -> pip install -U packaging
